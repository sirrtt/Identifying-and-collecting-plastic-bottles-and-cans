# Identifying-and-collecting-plastic-bottles-and-cans
In 2021, the globe expended 353 million tons of plastic rubbish, but recycled garbage amounted to just 9% of the total.

Viet Nam is one of the 20 countries with the largest amount of waste, significantly more than the
global average. Approximately 19% of rubbish is destroyed, and almost 50% is buried in licensed
landfills. Waste categorization is an essential and practical problem that can aid in environmental
protection. We require a trash classification tool to lower the cost of categorizing trash at recycling
plants, and it assists in collecting and categorizing rubbish as soon as feasible. Roboca is a robot
that can auto-detect and classify two types of recycling trash - bottles and cans. It will be placed
in public places such as parks, streets, playgrounds, and various other public areas.
